If you completed this quest from the command prompt interface on your local PC, you need to find the .aos.json keyfile for your processes and load this keyfile into your Arweave wallet app. This will create a new wallet from this process keyfile. Then connect that created wallet to the vouch site and vouch your processes.

Once successfully vouched, send the following claim command from your process.
